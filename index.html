        <p class="articletext">Hi, I'm Kevin and I graduated from Northwestern University with a BA in Classical Studies. You probably couldn't guess from my major, but I was a premed student for all four years of my college education. After a ridiculous amount of effort getting good grades in my premed classes, I actually decided not to go to med school. Shame, isn't it? Anyways, after 2 years spent recovering from the traumas of my difficult college life and thinking about my career options, I decided to do something entirely different and go into CS. I will be spending the next 6 months learning to code at Northwestern's Coding Boot Camp, and hopefully I will be able to finally work out my career path. We'll see how that works out.</p>
